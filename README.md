# SuiteCRM Login Tracker
It is not what the software does, it is what the user does with the software that makes your CRM software successful in your business.

Are Your Users Even Logging In?
================

4 out of 5 senior executives informed that their biggest challenge was getting their staff to use the software. CRM success is often dependent on your ability to track and measure adoption of the software in your organization and this tool finally fills the void within the SuiteCRM platform.

Make sure that your sales people are not missing on opportunities any longer by simply tracking their login history, and pro actively reporting across all your users of SuiteCRM. With this add in, you can now manage and track who is logging into your CRM system and using it, and track those who are not actively using it. SuiteCRM does not have this ability built in, and this is a great tool to help you manage user adoption in your organization.
